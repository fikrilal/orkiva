# Pending Implementation Tasks (Post Verification on `development`)

This list is derived from failed rows in `_WIP/mvp_acceptance_checklist.md` after code-based verification.

## Pending Items

| ID | Gap | What Still Needs Implementation | Suggested Target Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| - | None | All checklist gaps are currently marked pass after code verification. | - |

## Notes

- All other checklist rows are currently marked pass with evidence links in `_WIP/mvp_acceptance_checklist.md`.
- This file tracks implementation gaps only. Operational re-verification should still run full `verify` before release decisions.
